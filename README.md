# Technical Practice Test

This practice test has been designed to help prospective students prepare for and pass the Technical Exam required for acceptance into the CodeWorks® Immersive Fullstack Course. 

Students will need to demonstrate proficiencies in each of the 5 sections below. 

Successful completion of the exam follows a three strike system. Students must complete the tasks associated with each section missing no more than 2 tasks overall.

In this repository you are provided with three starting files to demonstrate your skill. 

While the sections will not change when taking the actual exam the sub-tasks will vary so be sure to study and understand how to accomplish each of these tasks without references for the actual exam.
